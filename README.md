Checks your python style:
PEP 8 - instuructions for coding - https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
pythonstule - command that can check a script but first >>pip install pycodestyle
style aligning to ussual code makes code easier for other readers
its nice to include DOI of softwer (zenodo.org can make a DOI for a specific software) - make reaserch reproducible
my program shoud be discoverable - good to put key words in the description and specify topics 

license for program: >create new file: MyDemoRepo/LICENCE and github genetares one, i guess
   apache licence - is more permisive - short, alows a lot
   gpl (general public license) - doesnt alow much stuff
